    "## This algorithm is essentially Minimax, but it chooses the second-best option for your opponent if there is enough of an evaluation difference between your opponent's first and second-best options and there are a substantial number of move choices on your opponent's turn. That is, it prioritizes traps by assuming that your opponent will make a mistake but that, if they get it correct, your evaluation is still in the \"drawish range.\"\n",
